    "The only trouble I have with it is keeping track of dependencies, especially when you have multiple projects or expect other people to use your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, I'll show you how to set up a new nbdev project using [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/), a tool for managing Python dependencies. This will allow you to easily create a new project, install dependencies, and run your code without having to worry about setting up a virtual environment."
