    "If you're reading this, you're probably familiar with [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/), a system for creating Python libraries from Jupyter notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "The only trouble I have with it is keeping track of dependencies, especially when you have multiple projects or expect other people to use your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, I'll show you how to set up a new nbdev project using [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/), a tool for managing Python dependencies. This will allow you to easily create a new project, install dependencies, and run your code without having to worry about setting up a virtual environment.\n",

    "If you're not familiar with Pipenv, it's a tool for managing Python dependencies. It's similar to [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/), [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) or [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), but it's a bit more user-friendly.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you want to add a new dependency, you can run `pipenv install <package_name>`. This will install the package and add it to the `Pipfile`, keeping track of the version you installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to install a specific version of a package, you can run `pipenv install <package_name>==<version>`. This will install the package and add it to the `Pipfile` with the specified version.\n"
