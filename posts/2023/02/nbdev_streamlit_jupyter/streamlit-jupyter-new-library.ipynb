    "## Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "Hey there, I created a library [streamlit-jupyter](https://github.com/ddobrinskiy/streamlit-jupyter) to allow for seamless creation of streamlit apps in jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way this works is it detects your environment, and if the script is run from a jupyter notebook, then it wraps existing streamlit methods to replace them with ipywidgets alternatives - that way you can code as you would in streamlit, and then displays your page as-you-code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you export your notebook to a `.py` file, and run it via streamlit as usual (no change in behaviour there)\n",
    "\n",
    "## References\n",
    "\n",
    "This builds on the shoulders of giants, and would not be possible without these amazing packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)\n",
    "* [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) \n",
    "* [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/) by Jeremy Howard, the author of [fast.ai](https://fast.ai)\n",
    "\n",
    "More on each:\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most likely jupyter needs no introduction, it is the de-facto tool for anyone doing scientific programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) is a framework to create interactive python apps (mostly focused on data analytics, but can be anything).\n",
    "\n",
    "It can have dropdowns, tables, maps, charts et cetera:\n",
    "![alt](images/img5_streamlit.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example someone built this awesome [background remover](https://bgremoval.streamlit.app/) in Streamlit, see [streamlit gallery](https://streamlit.io/gallery) for more great examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "I love Streamlit because it is perfect for sharing your work with others, especially in a work-related setting: giving your stakeholders a clickable and responsive app is so much better than a pdf or html version of your notebook!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/)\n",
    "\n",
    "[nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/) is a literate programming environment based on jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that your notebooks become a single source of truth for code, tests and documentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main reason that I love it (and chose it for this project), is that a regular Data Science project has a workflow that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* code something up in your jupyter\n",
    "* move helper functions to utils.py\n",
    "* experiment with different approaches\n",
    "* copy-paste your code to `app.py`\n",
    "* don't forget to update the docs in your `.md` files (or, god forbid, notion/confluence üíÄ)\n",
    "* now if something doesn't work, or you want to make some changes - start at the beginning\n",
    "\n",
    "Nbdev combines all of those steps into a single place - your jupyter notebooks. And exporting your code as a library works seamlessly behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jeremy Howard from fast.ai explains the benefits more eloquently in his [I like notebooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk) video.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tying it all together\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, combining all of those together means that you, as a developer, never have to leave jupyter, and can visually iterate on your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "And all of that gets exported into Streamlit, so that your project is always shareable and usable to anyone with a browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "[streamlit-jupyter](https://github.com/ddobrinskiy/streamlit-jupyter) is the missing puzzle-piece here, since it allows you to _see_ how your streamlit app will look like, without having to leave jupyter."

    "## How to use it\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at our [example notebook](https://github.com/ddobrinskiy/streamlit-jupyter/blob/master/examples/99_example.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is for you experiment and develop in your notebook,\n",
    "visually see all the pieces, and then convert the notebook to `.py` to\n",
    "be run by streamlit\n",
    "\n",
    "start by importing streamlit and patching it with streamlit-jupyter:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "\n",
    "import streamlit as st\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "StreamlitPatcher().jupyter()  # register streamlit with jupyter-compatible wrappers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And now develop your notebook as usual, but with the ability to use\n",
    "Streamlit widgets and components.\n",
    "\n",
    "See how it works below, and check out the [example](https://github.com/ddobrinskiy/streamlit-jupyter/blob/master/examples/99_example.ipynb) (it also incudes a nifty alternative to nbconvert that strips out all the magics and other irrelevant stuff)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lifehack: Easy export of your notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to export a notebook is NOT `jupyter nbconvert`, trust me on this.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/), and instead of running nbconvert from your terminal, do these 2 things:\n",
    "\n",
    "* add `#|export` comment to the beginning of cells that you want exported as scripts\n",
    "    * all the other cells will NOT be exported, so you can use them as playground without having to clean \n",
    "* add this cell to the end of your notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from nbdev.export import nb_export\n",
    "nb_export('app.ipynb', lib_path='.', name='app')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And that's it, your `app.py` is now fully syncronized with your notebook.\n",
    "\n",
